# Student_clustring_UL_Learning
Student Learning Behavior Clustering This project uses unsupervised machine learning to identify and group students based on their learning behavior: specifically time spent on quizzes, videos, and notes.  Using KMeans clustering and PCA, students are grouped into behavior-based clusters (e.g., quiz-focused learners).
